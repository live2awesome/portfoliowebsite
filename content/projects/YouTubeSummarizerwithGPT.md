### Project Description
The "YouTube Summarizer with GPT" project is a personal initiative aimed at exploring the capabilities of the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for text summarization in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal was to gain a deep understanding of Large Language Models (LLM) and harness the power of the OpenAI GPT API for creating a YouTube video summarization tool.

### Key Features and Learning Objectives
1. **Understanding LLM and Text Summarization:**
   - Created a Jupyter Notebook to delve into the concepts of Large Language Models and the fundamentals of text summarization.
   - Explored how OpenAI's GPT API can be utilized for extracting meaningful summaries from textual content.

2. **Integration with YouTube Data:**
   - Explored techniques to fetch and process data from YouTube videos, preparing it for input to the summarization model.
   - Investigated methods to handle video transcripts and convert them into a format suitable for GPT-based summarization.

3. **GPT API Integration:**
   - Utilized the OpenAI GPT API to generate concise and coherent summaries for YouTube videos.
   - Explored the capabilities and limitations of the GPT model in the context of video content summarization.

### Technical Highlights
- **Technology Stack:**
  - Python, Jupyter Notebook, OpenAI GPT API
- **Codebase:**
  -- **Jupyter Notebook:** [YouTube Summarizer with GPT](https://github.com/live2awesome/Youtube-Summarizer-with-GPT)
- **Outcome:**
  - Gained hands-on experience in working with OpenAI's GPT API.
  - Improved understanding of text summarization techniques and their application to real-world problems.

### Future Enhancements
This project serves as a foundation for future enhancements and features. Potential areas for improvement include:
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Developing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the YouTube Summarizer tool.
- **Scalability:** Exploring ways to scale the summarization process for a larger volume of videos.
- **Multi-language Support:** Extending the tool to support summarization for videos in multiple languages.
