**Abstract:**
  In India, approximately 70% of the population depends on agriculture. However, crop productivity has not kept up with the increasing demand, necessitating the use of advanced technology. This project focuses on smart farming and precision farming, utilizing IoT, sensors, controllers, and AI/ML to predict suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters.

### B. Objectives of the Project
- Study different soil types and crops suitable for each type.
- Identify and select sensors for soil and environment parameters.
- Create classification and prediction models for soil and crops.
- Train, test, and deploy the system on a suitable cloud platform.
- Build an Android app for farmers to interact with the system.

**Project Architecture:**

### C. Scope & Limitations
**Scope:**
- Decision-making support for farmers.
- Soil health awareness.
- Economic benefits in the agriculture sector.

**Limitations:**
- Dynamic nature of soil.
- Changing weather conditions.
- Uncertainty in environmental factors.
